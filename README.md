# üè¶ Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

A supervised learning project to predict loan approval decisions based on applicants financial and credit attributes using advanced classification models.

---
## üìñ Overview  
This project builds a robust machine learning pipeline to classify loan applications as approved or rejected. It includes:

- Data cleaning  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Final submission generation  

---
## ‚ùì Problem Statement  
Financial institutions must balance risk and profitability when approving loans. Approving high-risk applicants can lead to defaults, while rejecting low-risk ones may reduce revenue. This project aims to build a predictive model that accurately classifies loan applications to optimize approval decisions.
